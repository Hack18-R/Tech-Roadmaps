
 WHAT TO LEARN IN DSA

-------------------------------
 1) DATA STRUCTURES — WHAT TO LEARN
-------------------------------

- What it is
- How it organizes/stores data
- What operations it supports
- Time complexity of each operation
- Space usage
- When it should be used
- Strengths and weaknesses
- How to implement it
- How to apply it in problems


-------------------------------
 2) ALGORITHMS — WHAT TO LEARN
-------------------------------

- What the algorithm does
- The step-by-step process/flow
- Why it works (core logic)
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Situations where it is useful
- Variations of the algorithm
- How to implement it
- How to apply it in problems


-------------------------------
 3) PATTERNS — WHAT TO LEARN
-------------------------------

- The main idea of the pattern
- Trigger conditions that indicate using it
- Template/structure of the approach
- Logic flow of the pattern
- When the pattern is effective
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Variations or alternative forms
- How to apply it to problems
- How to recognize it in new problems
