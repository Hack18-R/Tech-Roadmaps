
MASTER DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS 

1. ESSENTIAL DSA TOPICS

Data Structures:
  Linear:
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Hash Tables
  Nonlinear:
    - Trees
    - Binary Search Trees
    - Heaps
    - Graphs
    - Tries
    - Union Find

Algorithms:
  - Sorting
  - Binary Search
  - Bit Manipulation
  - Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order)
  - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Shortest Path)

Problem Solving Techniques / Patterns:
  - Two Pointers
  - Sliding Window
  - Recursion
  - Backtracking
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms

Note: Always understand Time and Space Complexity.


2. RECOMMENDED LEARNING ORDER

1. Learn Linear Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues).
2. Learn Basic Algorithms and Patterns (Two Pointers, Recursion, Sorting, Searching).
3. Move to Hierarchical Data Structures (Trees, Heaps).
4. Study Complex Algorithms (Greedy, Dynamic Programming).
5. Learn Graphs and Union Find last.


3. HOW TO MASTER A NEW TOPIC

- Start with the basics: concept, operations, time and space complexity.
- Implement the data structure or algorithm from scratch.
- Learn how to use built-in libraries in your programming language.
- Solve 4 to 5 easy problems after learning the basics.
- Remember: Real mastery comes from problem solving, not just tutorials.


4. KEY STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENT

- Challenge yourself: move from easy to medium level problems gradually.
- Understand concepts instead of memorizing solutions.
- Think in patterns: identify common techniques like Two Pointers or Sliding Window.


5. REVISION AND RETENTION STRATEGY

- Repetition: revisit concepts and problems regularly.
- Use the 2-List Revision Method:
    Revision One: Problems you could not solve and needed to check the solution.
    Revision Two: Problems solved correctly after moving from Revision One.
    If solved again from Revision Two, you have mastered that problem.
- Be consistent: solve at least one or two problems daily.
