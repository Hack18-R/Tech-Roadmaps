                                                Problem Solving & DSA Mastery Roadmap

Step 1: Foundation / Basics
- Input / Output
- Conditional Logic (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Patterns (stars, numbers, alphabets)
- Number / Maths Logic (palindrome, factorial, prime, GCD/LCM, Fibonacci)
- Bit Manipulation (basic AND, OR, XOR, shift)

Step 2: Core Problem Solving / DSA
- Array (1D to 2D / Matrix)
- String
- Hash Table / Map / Frequency counting
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Prefix Sum

Step 3: Recursion & Backtracking
- Recursion basics
- Backtracking (subsets, permutations, simple paths)

Step 4: Fundamental Data Structures
- Stack
- Queue / Deque
- Linked List
- Binary Tree / Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Heap / Priority Queue

Step 5: Searching & Sorting
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)

Step 6: Advanced Logic / Algorithms
- Greedy
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Connected Components)
- Dynamic Programming (basic)
- Trie (basic string search)

Step 7: Practice Platforms
- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- GeeksforGeeks (GFG)

Step 8: Projects
- Start small projects using arrays, strings, loops, logic
- Gradually integrate DSA + problem-solving techniques
