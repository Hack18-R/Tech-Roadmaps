
1. Git Basics (Beginner Level)

- Learn the core concepts and commands to start using Git effectively:
    - What is Git?
    - Version control systems overview
    - Installing Git on your system
    - Git configuration (`git config`) — username, email
    - Initialize a Git repository (`git init`)
    - Understanding the working directory, staging area, and repository

    Basic Commands:
        - `git status` — check repo status
        - `git add` — stage files
        - `git commit` — save changes
        - `git log` — view commit history
        - `git diff` — see changes

        - Ignoring files with `.gitignore`
        - Understanding snapshots vs diffs


2. Remote Repositories (Beginner - Intermediate)

- Learn how to work with remotes like GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:
    - What is a remote repository?
    - Cloning a repo (`git clone`)
    - Connecting a local repo to remote (`git remote add`)
    - Pushing changes (`git push`)
    - Pulling changes (`git pull`) and fetching (`git fetch`)
    - Understanding branches and the default branch (`main` or `master`)
    - Creating and switching branches (`git branch`, `git checkout`, `git switch`)


3. Branching & Merging (Intermediate)

- Handle multiple lines of development and merge changes:
    - Branching strategies (feature branches)
    - Merging branches (`git merge`)
    - Resolving merge conflicts
    - Fast-forward vs recursive merge
    - Deleting branches locally and remotely:
        - `git branch -d`
        - `git push origin --delete`


4. Rebasing & History Manipulation (Intermediate)

- Learn how to clean and rewrite commit history:
    - What is rebasing (`git rebase`)?
    - Interactive rebasing (`git rebase -i`)
    - Squashing commits
    - Amending commits (`git commit --amend`)
    - Resetting changes (`git reset` - soft, mixed, hard)
    - Reverting commits (`git revert`)


5. Collaboration Workflows (Intermediate)

- Understand how to work in teams with Git:
    - Forking workflow (common in open source)
    - Pull requests / merge requests (concepts)
    - Code reviews and comments
    - Handling conflicts collaboratively
    - Git hooks basics (pre-commit, post-commit)


6. Advanced Git Features 

- For deeper understanding and troubleshooting:
    - Stashing changes (`git stash`)
    - Tagging releases (`git tag`)
    - Using `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` effectively
    - Git submodules (including other repos)
    - Using Git with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
