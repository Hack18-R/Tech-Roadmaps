
STEP 1: WHAT YOU MUST LEARN FIRST (CORE SKILLS)

1) Business Basics
- What problem are you solving?
- Who will pay for it?
- How much will it cost to run?
Think in this order: Problem → Solution → Customer → Price → Profit.

2) Money / Finance Basics
You only need simple concepts at the start:
- Cash flow (money in – money out)
- Profit margin
- Costs (fixed / variable)
- Pricing
- Break-even point
Learn to use Excel or Google Sheets to track money.

3) Marketing Skills
You must know how to reach customers:
- Social media basics
- Branding
- Selling on WhatsApp or Instagram
- Creating simple ads
- Content creation (reels, posts, blogs)
Marketing means telling the world what you offer.

4) Sales Skill
This is the most important.
- How to talk to customers
- How to understand their needs
- How to close a sale confidently
Sales grows your business even if your product is not perfect.

5) Technology Skills (if your business uses tech)
Depending on your idea:
- Websites
- Apps
- AI tools
- No-code tools (Google Forms, Notion, Canva, Shopify)
You don’t need to be a coder, just understand basics.


STEP 2: TO START YOUR BUSINESS FROM ZERO

Step 1 — Find a Problem
Business starts with one question:
What problem do people have that I can solve?

Examples:
- People need quick food → start cloud kitchen
- Businesses need online presence → offer digital marketing
- Students want to learn skills → online tutoring
- Shops need digital software → SaaS solutions


Step 2 — Choose Your Skills and Resources
Ask yourself:
- What are you good at?
- What do people ask you for help with?
- What skills can you learn in 30–60 days?


Step 3 — Start Very Small (MVP)
MVP means simple version of your business. Do not build full app or shop at first.

Examples:
- Instead of building an app → create WhatsApp service
- Instead of opening big shop → start from home
- Instead of spending money → use free tools


Step 4 — Test With Real Customers
Sell to 10 customers first.
If they love it → continue.
If they don’t → fix it and try again.
This saves money and time.


Step 5 — Build Your Brand
Simple branding:
- Name
- Logo (use Canva)
- Instagram page
- WhatsApp Business
- Simple website (optional)


Step 6 — Register Your Business
Once you start earning:
- Register as sole proprietor
- Do GST only if required
- Open business bank account
Focus on sales first, legal work later.


Step 7 — Grow
Use:
- Better marketing
- Customer feedback
- Automation tools
- Hire people slowly
